### Problem 0

This “problem” focuses on structure of your submission, especially the
use git and GitHub for reproducibility, R Projects to organize your
work, R Markdown to write reproducible reports, relative paths to load
data from local files, and reasonable naming structures for your files.
This was not prepared as a GitHub repo.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 2

The raw dataset includes 12 variables: the individual’s unique id
number; homicide report date (listed as yyyymmdd); victim information
such as first and last name, age, and sex; location of the homicide
including coordinates; and status of the case.

Create city_state variable and classify current disposition variable
into solved/unsolved

``` r
homicide = 
  read_csv("prob2_data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "Unknown")) %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = paste(city, state, sep=","),
    status = case_when(
        disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "Solved",
        disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "Unsolved",
        disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "Unsolved"))
```
